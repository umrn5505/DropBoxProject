# Available Work for Team Members

## Major Features Available for Implementation

### 1. Quota Management System (High Priority)
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days
**Difficulty:** Medium-High
**Description:** Implement a comprehensive quota management system for user file storage limits.

**Components to Implement:**
- `quota_management.c` - Core quota operations
- Quota tracking structures and functions
- User quota initialization and persistence
- Quota enforcement in file operations
- Quota display in file listings

**Key Functions Needed:**
```c
// In dropbox_server.h
typedef struct {
    char username[MAX_USERNAME_LENGTH];
    size_t quota_limit_bytes;
    size_t used_bytes;
    int file_count;
    time_t last_updated;
} user_quota_t;

// Function declarations to implement
user_quota_t* load_user_quota(const char *username);
int save_user_quota(const user_quota_t *quota);
void destroy_user_quota(user_quota_t *quota);
int initialize_user_quota(const char *username, size_t quota_limit);
int update_quota_usage(const char *username, long long size_change);
int check_quota_availability(const char *username, size_t file_size);
```

**Integration Points:**
- Add quota checks in `handle_upload_task()` in file_operations.c
- Update quota usage in upload/delete operations
- Display quota information in `list_user_files()` in file_storage.c
- Add quota initialization in user signup process

### 2. Advanced File Encoding/Decoding (Medium Priority) 
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 days
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Description:** Implement Base64 encoding/decoding for file transfer optimization.

**Components to Implement:**
- Base64 encoding functions in utilities.c
- File content encoding during upload
- File content decoding during download
- Binary file handling improvements

**Key Functions Needed:**
```c
char* base64_encode(const unsigned char *data, size_t input_length, size_t *output_length);
unsigned char* base64_decode(const char *data, size_t input_length, size_t *output_length);
```

### 3. Additional Bonus Features (Lower Priority)

#### A. File Compression
- Implement gzip compression for uploaded files
- Automatic decompression on download
- Space-efficient storage

#### B. File Versioning
- Keep multiple versions of the same file
- Version history tracking
- Rollback capabilities

#### C. Advanced Conflict Resolution
- Automatic merge strategies
- Conflict detection algorithms
- User notification system

#### D. Performance Monitoring
- Operation timing statistics
- Thread pool performance metrics
- System resource monitoring

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features
- Multi-threaded server architecture (3-layer threading)
- Thread-safe queue operations with priority support
- Complete file operations (UPLOAD, DOWNLOAD, DELETE, LIST)
- File conflict resolution with locking mechanism
- SHA-256 checksum verification
- User authentication system integration
- Priority task system
- No busy waiting implementation
- Comprehensive error handling

### ðŸ”§ Ready for Enhancement
- File operations ready for quota integration
- Utilities module ready for encoding functions
- Thread-safe infrastructure supports additional features

## Development Guidelines

### For Quota Management Implementation:
1. Create `quota_management.c` file
2. Add quota structure definitions to `dropbox_server.h`
3. Integrate quota checks in file operations
4. Add quota persistence (file-based storage)
5. Update Makefile to include quota_management.c
6. Test quota enforcement and display

### For Encoding/Decoding Implementation:
1. Add Base64 functions to `utilities.c`
2. Modify upload/download handlers to use encoding
3. Ensure binary file compatibility
4. Add error handling for encoding failures
5. Test with various file types

### Testing Recommendations:
- Test quota limits with large files
- Verify quota persistence across server restarts
- Test encoding with binary and text files
- Stress test with multiple concurrent users
- Verify thread safety of new components

## Branch Information
- Current branch: `feature/enhanced-implementation`
- Base branch: `main`
- All core infrastructure is complete and stable

This provides substantial, meaningful work that integrates well with the existing codebase while allowing each team member to contribute significantly to the project.
