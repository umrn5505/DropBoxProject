## üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### For You:
1. **Test the Implementation** (when you have access to a C compiler):
   ```bash
   make clean
   make
   ./dropbox_server
   # In another terminal:
   ./enhanced_test_client
   ```

2. **Push Your Branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/enhanced-implementation
   ```

3. **Create Pull Request** on GitHub to merge into main

### For Your Team:
1. **Review the implementation** together
2. **Test thoroughly** with multiple concurrent clients
3. **Decide on additional features** to implement
4. **Divide remaining work** among team members
5. **Integrate and test** all components together
